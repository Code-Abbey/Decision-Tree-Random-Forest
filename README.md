# Decision-Tree-Random-Forest

Objective


We are going to predict once again if a passenger on the Titanic is going to survive or not using decision trees and random forests this time: 

1. Load Titanic dataset: A training set and Testing set Apply decision tree. 

2. Plot decision tree and try to read the tree branches and conclude a prediction manually.

3. Change the decision tree parameters(change at least two parameters), 

4. Calculate the new accuracy and compare it with the previous results. 

5. Use random forest then change the number of estimators

6. Calculate the new accuracy and compare it with the previous result.
